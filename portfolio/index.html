        Silly Labs intro deck

    </h3>
    <p>
      This is a short deck I've recently built with my occasional consulting partner to showcase some of the recent work we've done with startups and tech projects.

        Goosebump pitch deck slides (shareable)
      </a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Because it's a bit of a moving target, I still need to wrap my experience with Goosebump into a well-built case study, but to make up for it I'm attaching a few product-related slides from their Pitch Deck (these are not-so-confidential-slides which I got permission to share with non-competitors).

        Spotify Case Study: Marketing tools for Spotify Premium
      </a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      From one simple landing page generator app, we then built an entire ecosystem of marketing tools (called Toolbelt, which would require a walkthrough). Both Web Pages and App UIs that the tool allows to create and customize rely on their specific Component Library, which I maintained, together with another colleague for all things App-related.

        Spotify Case Study: Spotify x Google Premium Campaign
      </a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      This is a quick adaptation from the types of decks that usually accompany my work in the early stages of the product and design process, which I like to show people. In this case, for the popular Spotify x Google Home Mini campaigns in UK, US, DE, FR, and CA.

        Zalando Help Center Case Study
      </a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Although I mostly worked within their Mobile Apps team, I had the opportunity to embed in a different (and neglected) team at Zalando: Customer Care who enjoyed very little R&D support, as well as being locked into old vendor contracts. The project was to redesign the Help Center experience. The case study itself highlights the Product and Design development process I typically follow.
What started with the idea of lower costs for Customer Care ended up becoming a cornerstone project for the team and their future tech strategy.
